6. Contact (phassa)	Contact between the six sense bases and their objects arises.	Develop non-attachment to the objects of contact.
7. Feeling (vedana)	Feelings arise from contact.	Develop equanimity towards all feelings, whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
8. Craving (tanha)	Craving arises from feelings.	Cultivate contentment and let go of craving for things that are impermanent and unsatisfactory.
